Issima is a simple frontend application made in React JS for a friend of mine.
He asked me to create a web application oriented for mobile devices.
The purpose of the app is to allow customers to place orders payable on delivery (No payment mechanism is therefore integrated into the web app).
After entering the data, an email is sent with the order information.

The application is made up of three simple screens: the first, the one in which the customer can select the products to buy, the second screen in which to enter data and the last one for orders summary.
Since there is no beckend, sending the email is managed via the EmailJS api
